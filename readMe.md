/dashboard
    This will be the page that holds all of our services that our customer may select from with it's primary function being
    providing description to each service and allowing redirect to said service pages.
    /dashboard.html

Not much to say here, just holds images that we'll be using
/images

/js

/login
    Just your standard login page
    /login.html

/register
    Will enquire a new user to input a username, password, email and phone number. 
    /register.html

/services
    Here will be all the landing pages of our different services. Currently there's nothing actually unique about any of these aside from the fact that one of them has a
    working backend handler, that being the drycleaning.html. I should also say, the order page was made for the drycleaning.html specifically then just copy pasted
    with their own indentifying headers
    /coffee.html
    /drycleaning.html
    /party.html
    /rx.html

    This will be the order confirmation page for all of our services. How exactly I'm going to handle that, not to sure yet, but it also doesn't make sense to have
    an order confirmation page specifically for each service. What's so unique that it requires an entirely different html page?
    /confimation.html

/styling
    Site wide UI Style guide
    /style.css
 
This will be the first that any user will encounter if they go to our URL where they will be presented with the option to either login or register with WeGo services
/index.html
